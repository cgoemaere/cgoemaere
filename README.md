## Who am I?
- 👨‍🎓 PhD student working on Hopfield networks
- 🏛 Ghent University + imec + FWO
- 🤝 Supervised by prof. [Thomas Demeester](https://tdmeeste.github.io/) and [Johannes Deleu](https://biblio.ugent.be/person/801001994419)

## Research interests
- 🎯 Primary goal: stable training of large Hopfield networks
- 💡 Interested in Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) and advanced training strategies for deep neural networks.
- 🌈 Ultimate goal: Hopfield networks + analog electronics + Equilibrium Propagation = ⚡🧠
- 👀 Tracks developments in NLP, Predictive Coding and Active Inference
